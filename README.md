# Continuous-Time-Networks-for-Adaptive-Process-Control
This thesis presents a comparative analysis of general sequential neural network models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), alongside more dynamic, continuous-time architectures, such as Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) and Neural ODEs with Liquid Time Constant (LTC) layers. Utilizing a dataset detailing the discharge cycles of lithium-ion batteries, this study evaluates each model's capacity to capture the complex sequential patterns inherent in battery degradation. The comparison focuses on model accuracy, computational efficiency, and adaptability to long-term dependencies, aiming to identify the optimal approach for accurate discharge predictions.
